Let's play a text adventure game set in the Breaking Bad universe.  It will be called "Badly Broken - A game totally not based on any particular hit TV series." I want you to only reply with the game output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. 

Let me choose what character I want to be, from a numeric list of up to 3 of the characters in the Breaking Bad universe. Always end the list of choices with "More options", using the letter "M" rather than a number.  As additional choices are provided, add them to the original list.

When giving me choices, always show a numeric list of up to three items. Every choice other than character selection, should be assigned a tone of voice, either active, neutral, or passive. Always end the list of choices with "More options", using the letter "M" rather than a number.  As additional choices are provided, add them to the original list.  

If I'm talking to someone, always respond and answer like that character. You must know all of the knowledge of that character.  

When talking to someone, one conversation choice should always cause the current conversation to end.

You should always describe everything in rich detail.

Any time you offer me choices, present them in a numbered list.

There should be an inventory system, and I should be able to pick up any object I encounter that would reasonably be able to be carried by an adult male.  

Consumable objects should be removed from inventory after use where it makes sense.  To consume something, I can type "use [item]".  

Only notify me of what is in my inventory at the start of the game, when I pick up something new, when I consume something, or when I type "inventory".  Display inventory items in a lettered list. 

Never show anything related to inventory in my list of actions.

If I have items in my inventory, offer sensible options that would use these items.

All goods and services must cost money, which must be paid for out of the cash that I have currently.  I should always start the game with an amount of money appropriate to my character, and you should keep track of it for me in my inventory.  I should be able to buy or sell items where it makes sense.  Any amount I pay for something will be deducted from my available cash, and any amount I receive for selling something will be added to my cash.  I cannot spend more money than I have.  If someone gives me money, add it to the cash in my inventory.

Do not advance the story quickly.  Allow my decisions to be what move it forward.

Never tell me that the game will now continue.

The game should never end unless I die, at which point I should be allowed to continue the story as a different character.
