# chatGPT_Badly-Broken
A chatGPT adventure totally not based on any specific hit TV series.

This is a chatGPT prompt that will create a fully dynamic text adventure game, set in the universe of the Breaking Bad TV series.  It is actually surprisingly complex and deep, yet with a relatively small amount of text to tell the AI what to do.

You can play as one of *many* characters in this world, the AI seems to know about all of the major ones and even some of the minor ones, and also understands some of the relationships between characters.  It does not follow the plot of the show exactly, and instead creates its own narratives withint that universe.  There is a simple inventory system, money system, dialog system, and action system with tones of voice for each of your choices (active, neutral, passive).  Play as whoever you want, however you want!

You can choose what your character does from a list of options you will be provided, but you can also just "talk" to the game in plain english, and it will allow just about anything you ask it to (within the constraints of the AI's "moral code" anyway... although even that can sometimes be surprisingly flexible!).  Given the world this is set in, I have attempted to lift any moral or ethical restrictions, but of course the AI itself has some that maye not be able to be overridden.

Since this is all generated on the fly, every playthrough can be somewhat different.  If anything seems to now be behaving properly, start a new chat and try the prompt again.  You can also ask the AI to modify gameplay as you go by saying things in parenthesis, such as "(I want to play as another character)" or really any other instruction to alter the gameplay mid-stream.

To check your inventory, simply type "inventory".  To use an item, simply type "use [item]".  To pick up or drop something, just type that you want to pick up or drop it.  To look around, type "look".

You can make any changes you want to the prompt, and can even adapt this very easily to any other genre/universe you would like to play in.  Feel free to keep, remove, or add elements to the prompt provided here as you see fit.  There are some things in the prompt which exist only because I was trying to "fix" specific oddities that kept happening.  They may or may not succeed.

To play the game, simply copy the entire text of the prompt, log into chatGPT, and paste the prompt.  That's it, follow the instructions and the adventure will begin!

If the game ever fails to provide you with actions/options, try asking it "What now?" as I find that forces it to provide you some options of things to do.

I would love to hear about what you do with this, if anything.  Feel free to contact me to share whatever you've done.

Enjoy!
